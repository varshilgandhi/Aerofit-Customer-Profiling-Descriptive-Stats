# Aerofit – Customer Profiling Using Descriptive Statistics & Probability

This project analyzes customer data for Aerofit treadmill products using descriptive statistics and probability concepts. The goal is to help Aerofit identify customer profiles and patterns associated with each treadmill model (KP281, KP481, KP781), enabling better product targeting and business decisions.

---

## 📊 Problem Statement

Aerofit wants to improve its product recommendation system by understanding which types of customers buy specific treadmill models. This involves identifying patterns across demographics, income, fitness levels, and usage behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze the dataset to build customer profiles for each treadmill product.
- Identify key attributes influencing product selection (age, income, marital status, etc.).
- Calculate conditional and marginal probabilities using contingency tables.
- Visualize relationships using charts, heatmaps, and pairplots.
- Detect outliers and provide business insights and recommendations.
